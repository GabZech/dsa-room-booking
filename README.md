# An Instant Room Booking System at the Hertie School

As the final project for the Fall 2021 Data Structures & Algorithms course at the Hertie School, we developed a room booking system that optimizes the assignment of spaces based on individual users' preferences and allows members of the community to receive an instant booking confirmation.

Under the current system, real-life booking is not possible as each request needs to be manually confirmed by a member of staff. Additionally, students cannot see the capacity of the rooms, nor see all the available, free rooms. Everyone can book a random capacity which leads to inefficient use of space, e.g., there are rooms for 10, booked by 2 students. 

As a first step, our program prompts user input to gather relevant information about their preferences and match them with an available room.
